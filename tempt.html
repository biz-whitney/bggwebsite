                I am excited to collaborate with brands and institutions who not only promote

                within their work. This includes, but is not limited to: the labor

            “We are so grateful that our students at Herbicide-Free Campus had the opportunity to receive social media training from Kristy (Brown Girl Green). Kristy's approach to environmental advocacy through a racial justice lens is not only important, but it is absolutely necessary. We really appreciated Kristy tailoring her training to our specific issue of toxins, while also managing to keep the lessons of digital advocacy broad enough that they could be applied to any campaign or issue. Kristy holds a very important space in the climate movement today, and it is an honor to work with and learn from her.” - Mackenzie Feldman, Herbicide-Free Campus USA
